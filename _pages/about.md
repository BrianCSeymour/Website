Hi, I'm Brian. I am still working on this part ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

I made this website to help give tips to students interested in studying physics in high school and college. I am working on some future projects which will help give recommendations such as how to prepare for physics study in high school and get involved in research in college.

Halfway through undergraduate degree, I made an app to help students study physics with modifiable LaTeX flashcards.  [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.seymour.brian.latexflashcards&hl=en_US).
