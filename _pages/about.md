Hi, I'm Brian. I am still working on this part ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

I made this website to help give tips to students interested in studying physics in high school and college. 

Halfway through undergraduate degree, I made an app to help students study physics with modifiable LaTeX flashcards.  [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.seymour.brian.latexflashcards&hl=en_US).
