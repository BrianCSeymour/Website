title:  "LIGO SURF Final Report"
---

I spent the 2017 summer working with Marie Kasprazack, Arnaud Pele, and Adam Mullavey at LIGO Livingston through the Caltech SURF Program. I examined nonlinear angular noise coupling into differential arm length of the LIGO Livingston detector. This could be summarized in the following way: I modeled the change in optical path length in the interferometer cavity arms due to misalignment of the cavity mirrors. I did this through an geometric analysis of the change in path length of a Fabry-Perot cavity (such as LIGO uses).

 You can [view the final report here]({{ site.baseurl}}/assets/documents/Papers/LIGO-SURF/LIGOSURF_FinalReport_BrianSeymour.pdf) directly.
