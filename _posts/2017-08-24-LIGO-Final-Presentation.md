title:  "LIGO SURF Final Presentation"

I presented the results of my research at LIGO from the summer of 2017 at Caltech for the SURF final presentation.

 You can [view the final report here]({{ site.baseurl}}/assets/documents/Presentations/LIGO-SURF/BrianSeymour_FinalPresentation_LIGO_SURF.pdf) directly.

Alternatively, the full directory containing my work that summer can be found [here]( https://dcc.ligo.org/LIGO-T1700343/public).
