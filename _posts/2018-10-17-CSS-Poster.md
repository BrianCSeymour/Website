title:  "College Science Scholar Presentation"
---


I had the pleasure of presenting my research to a group of first year students who are interested in scientific research. I gave an introduction to my research with a poster describing black hole-pulsar tests of general relativity. I used the example of a theory of gravity with varying gravitational constant to show the process of bounding the time derivative of G.
